# Artificial-Intelligence-and-Cognitive-Processes
## Master's degree capstone project

Using the exceptional psychological and technical engine which is chess, this project attempts to approach the development of artificial intelligence from a different angle – instead of using current machine learning techniques for creating an application that can repeatedly cycle through a task in order to build an understanding of the data and problem to consistently increase its accuracy, this project attempts to produce an application that is patterned after the mindset of a particular chess champion in order to imitate that individual's choices of chess movements.

This approach is based off my personal view that true intelligence, however, has the capability to solve a problem which does not relate directly to any previous experience simply by reasoning on its own with its own understanding – this capability is not exclusive to human intelligence, but is rather found in all forms of biological life. This concept should be the example of what research in artificial intelligence is trying to achieve – not simply a non-biological machine that learns, but one that grows in the same manner as a child as it develops.

While the development of artificial intelligence to so closely match human cognition has been the focus of frequent fearmongering in the last few decades in many forms – from entertainment to political discourse – and for many reasons – from the removal of opportunities for people in employment to the enslavement of humankind by machines – this concept of childlike development is the core focus and belief of this research. Humanity has no fear that the opportunities available to its future progeny will have grave consequences for its current population, nor that its descendants will attempt to impose tyrannical control over it in the future; in like manner, the development of a true artificial intelligence will bring new and greater opportunities of knowledge, understanding, and growth for all the populace of Earth.
